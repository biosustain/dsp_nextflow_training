# **Nextflow fundamentals training**

Is your code reusable? Are your results reproducible? Tired of reinventing the wheel? The thing is that reproducibility and even repeatability is challenging even if you are very careful about keeping the same software parameters and versions. Do you want to learn how to write reusable, reproducible, and scalable pipelines?

**Nextflow** is an advanced workflow management system designed to streamline data-driven processes, especially in the bioinformatics and computational biology fields. It allows users to develop, to execute, and to scale complex workflows across various environments (i.e local machine, Cloud - Azure, AWS, etc... - or HPC). This system is simple and flexible and supports different programming languages (i.e. Python, R, Bash) and containers (e.g Docker, Singularity, etc...).

Let us introduce you to Nextflow and unlock you a door to a vibrant community building and maintaining standardized reproducible bioinformatics analyses, trainings, hackathons and resources to make your data-driven analysis scalable an reproducible.

## Nextflow training notes

Welcome to the notes for the Nextflow training offered to the researchers of DTU - Biosustain and DTU - Bioengineering. This course is half dedicated to explain Nextflow fundamentals and half dedicated to practice Nextflow. The materials are based mostly on [Nextflow trainings portal](https://training.nextflow.io/). 

Please visit [About](https://biosustain.github.io/dsp_nextflow_training/about.html) to know about the course, the Data Science platform and what the course covers, go to Course Information to figure out about the details ([instructions](https://biosustain.github.io/dsp_nextflow_training/course_information/Instructions.html), [location](https://biosustain.github.io/dsp_nextflow_training/course_information/Location.html) and [timing](https://biosustain.github.io/dsp_nextflow_training/course_information/Timing.html)). Please visit Instructions first before starting the hands-on part. Once you have started your Codespace, please follow course along in the Course contents. To keep learning Nextflow and nf-core pipelines please visit [Resources](https://biosustain.github.io/dsp_nextflow_training/resources.html).

And remember to ask questions during the course or after the course, you can contact us at [Data Science platform email](mailto:datascience@biosustain.dtu.dk).
